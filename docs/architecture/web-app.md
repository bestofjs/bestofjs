## Web Application

The Web Application is the primary user-facing component of Best of JS, providing a browsable interface for exploring JavaScript project trends. This document details the architecture, features, and integration points of the web application within the broader Best of JS system.

## 1. Purpose and Role

The Best of JS Web Application serves as the public interface for displaying curated JavaScript projects and their trending data. It enables users to:

- Browse and search projects across various categories and tags
- View project details including star history and growth trends
- Compare projects within categories
- Create personal bookmarks for favorite projects (with GitHub sign-in)
- Discover rising projects in the JavaScript ecosystem

The application consumes data from the static API generated by the backend system and presents it through an intuitive web interface.

## 2. Architecture Overview

### 2.1 System Context

The Web Application operates within the Best of JS ecosystem as follows:

The Web Application serves as the presentation layer, consuming data from the static API and providing interactive features for users.

### 2.2 Component Structure

The Web Application is structured as a modern frontend application with the following components:

This component architecture separates concerns between routing, data access, and specific feature implementations.

## 3. Data Model

The Web Application consumes project data from the static API in a standardized format:

```
ProjectItem
name: string
slug: string
added_at: string
description: string
url?: string
stars: number
full_name: string
owner_id: number
created_at: string
pushed_at: string
contributor_count: number
status: string
tags: string[]
trends: TrendData
npm?: string
downloads?: number
icon?: string

TrendData
daily?: number
weekly?: number
monthly?: number
yearly?: number
```

This data structure represents each project displayed in the interface, with trend data showing star growth across different time periods.

## 4. Key Features

### 4.1 Project Browsing and Discovery

The Web Application provides various ways to discover projects:

| Feature | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Tag Categorization | Browse projects by tags (e.g., framework, component, chart) |
| Trending Views | Filter projects by daily, weekly, monthly, or yearly growth |
| Hot Projects | Highlight projects with significant recent star growth |
| Search | Full-text search across projects |

Projects are organized by tags that classify them into relevant categories, making it easy to find related technologies.

### 4.2 Project Details

For each project, the application displays:

- Basic metadata (name, description, repository)
- Star count and historical trends
- NPM download statistics (when applicable)
- Tags and categorization
- README content
- Contributor statistics

### 4.3 User Personalization

The Web Application provides personalization features:

Signed-in users can bookmark projects to create a personalized collection of projects they want to follow closely.

## 5. Integration with Other Systems

### 5.1 Static API Consumption

The Web Application relies on the static API generated by the backend:

The application fetches pre-generated JSON files with project data, rather than making direct database queries, improving performance and scalability.

### 5.2 Tag System

The Web Application uses a tag system to categorize projects:

Projects are associated with one or more tags, allowing users to browse related technologies and find alternatives within the same category.

## 6. User Interface Components

The Web Application provides a modern, responsive user interface with the following key components:

| Component | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| Project Cards | Display project summary with key metrics |
| Star History Chart | Visualize star growth over time |
| Tag Navigator | Browse projects by category |
| Search Box | Find projects by keyword |
| User Menu | Access bookmarks and account features |
| Trending Filters | Filter projects by trend period |

Each component is designed to make project discovery and comparison intuitive and efficient.

## 7. Deployment and Runtime

The Web Application is deployed as a static site for optimal performance.

This deployment approach provides fast loading times globally and scales effectively to handle user traffic.

## Summary

The Web Application is the public-facing component of Best of JS, providing an intuitive interface for exploring JavaScript project trends. It consumes data from the static API generated by the backend system and offers features for project discovery, comparison, and bookmarking. The application's architecture focuses on performance and user experience, making it easy for developers to stay informed about the JavaScript ecosystem.

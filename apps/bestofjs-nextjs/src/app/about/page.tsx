            Checking the number of stars on GitHub is a good way to check
            project popularity but it does not tell you when the stars have been
            added.{" "}
          </p>
          <p className="mt-2">
            {APP_DISPLAY_NAME} takes &quot;snapshot&quot; of GitHub stars every
            day, for a curated list of {count} projects, to detect the trends
            over the last months.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div>
          <h2 className="text-xl">How it works</h2>
          <p className="mt-2">
            First, a list of projects related to the web platform and Node.js
            (JavaScript, Typescript, but also HTML and CSS) is stored in our
            database.
          </p>
          <p className="mt-2">
            Every time we find a new interesting project, we add it to the
            database.
          </p>
          <p className="mt-2">
            Then everyday, an automatic task checks project data from GitHub,
            for every project stored and generates data consumed by the web
            application.
          </p>
          <p className="mt-2">
            The web application displays the total number of stars and their
            variation over the last days.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div>
          <h2 className="text-xl">Do you want more projects?</h2>
          <p className="mt-2">
            Rather than scanning all existing projects on GitHub, we focus on a
            curated list of projects we find &quot;interesting&quot;, based on
            our experience and on things we read on the internet.
          </p>
          <p className="mt-2">
            As a result, some great projects must be missing!

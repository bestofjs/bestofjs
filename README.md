## Concept

[Best of JS](https://bestofjs.org/) gathers the latest trends about open source projects related to the web platform and Node.js: JavaScript and TypeScript of course (client and server side) but also HTML, CSS, languages that compile to JavaScript, alternative runtimes such as Deno and Bun...

This is a place where full-stack developers can find the best components to build amazing web applications.

## Tags

Projects are carefully classified under tags such as:

- [Component Toolkits](https://bestofjs.org/tags/component): Sets of UI components for your favorite framework
- [UI frameworks](https://bestofjs.org/tags/framework): solutions to build front-end applications that run in the browser: React, Vue.js, Angular...
- [Node.js frameworks](https://bestofjs.org/projects?tags=nodejs-framework): solutions to build server-side applications with Node.js: Express, Nest, Fastify...
- [Charting](https://bestofjs.org/tags/chart): data visualization and chart libraries: D3, ChartJS, ECharts...
- [And many more!](https://bestofjs.org/tags/)

## Community-driven

If you find an interesting project to add, you can suggest it by [creating an issue here](https://github.com/michaelrambeau/bestofjs/issues/new?template=add-a-project-to-best-of-javascript.md).

You can sign-in with your GitHub account to bookmark the projects you want to follow closely.

## How it works

We maintain a list of interesting projects related to Node.js and the web platform in a database.

Everyday a scheduled task checks project data from GitHub and generates data consumed by the web application.
Basically _Best of JS_ tracks the number of stars of a curated list of about 2000 projects.

The web application displays the variations over the last days, weeks and months in order to show the trends about the JavaScript landscape.

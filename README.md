## How it works

We maintain a list of projects related to Note.js and the web platform in a database.

Every time we find a new project, or anytime a user submits a new request, we add it to the database.

Everyday a scheduled task checks project data from GitHub and generates data consumed by the web application.

The web application displays the total number of stars and their variation over the last days, weeks and months.
